# **SUI Smart Contracts**

## **Overview**

This directory contains smart contracts designed for the SUI Blockchain, each serving a specific purpose in the decentralized ecosystem. These contracts are developed using **Move Studio**, a complete Sui development suite built into the browser and tailored for the SUI Blockchain, simplifying the life of developers in the SUI ecosystem.

_Many more contracts are planned to be included soon!_

## **Contracts**
